## Overview

Project - Full-Stack MERN Application (Frontend)

### Scenario

You are a full-stack developer hired by a growing startup to lead the development of their new flagship product, “Pro-Tasker”. The vision is to create a modern, collaborative project management tool that is intuitive for single users but powerful enough for small teams. The application must be built from the ground up using the MERN stack, showcasing a secure, robust, and feature-rich backend API, a dynamic and responsive React frontend, and a seamless deployment pipeline.

This capstone project is the culmination of your journey through the MERN stack curriculum. It is designed to challenge you to integrate everything you have learned — from backend architecture and database design to frontend state management and deployment — into a single, polished, and real-world application. You are expected to reuse and expand upon the patterns and code you developed in previous modules, particularly the “TaskMaster” API and the deployment labs.

### One Grain - Frontend

One Grain is a focused, minimalist task manager designed to help users make consistent progress—one small step at a time.
The frontend is built with React + TypeScript and emphasizes clean state management, thoughtful UI patterns, and a calm, distraction-free experience.

This repository contains the client-side application responsible for user interaction, task visualization, and API communication.
